## Professionalism Points ##

Roughly 1/3 of your grade (equivalent to a GRASP) will be based on your *professionalism* in class.  At the beginning of the term, you will start with full points.  Points will be deducted based on behaviors.


## Late Work ##
Late assignments will be accepted one day late for reduced credit.  After that, they will no longer be accepted.  I've found that this policy makes class better for everyone.
