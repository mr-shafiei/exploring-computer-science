Computing is one of the biggest forces of innovation and societal transformation of today. It opened up wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. But, computing is more than just computer literacy.  It is about the empowering experience that comes when one learns how to harness computers to solve problems like a computer scientist.

This version of Exploring Computer Science, provides a birds-eye-view of the field of computer science and introduces fundamental concepts using the visual programming languages Scratch, Snap and (potentially) the industry-standard programming languages C, Python or Javascript.

I hope you will become excited about computing and appreciate the breadth of the field along with the societal transformations and challenges that come along with technology. I hope that this class exposes you to the profound ways in which computers and technology have changed our world.
