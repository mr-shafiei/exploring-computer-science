title: Grades
---

<p>With reluctance, I've given into using engrade.  There are things I don't like about it, but I've made some adjustments to force it to fit more closely with our class goals and structure.</p>

<p>If I had a million hours in the day, I would update your grades in real-time.  But, I don't.  To keep everything sane and predictable, I will post grade updates on the following schedule.  If you come to class and do your work, you should have nothing to worry about.</p>
