# Goals

- Practice developing an abstraction for drawing shapes
- Build a custom block (function) that takes input (arguments):

<pre class="blocks">

    define Draw Square with sides () long
    
</pre>

# Instructions

Build custom blocks (functions) to draw different shapes of different sizes:

- Square (Tutorial Below)
- Triangle (Figure it out!)
- Hexagon (Figure it out!)
- Circle (Challenge!)


Then, use those functions as a part of a bigger program.

<pre class="blocks">
    define Draw Square
    repeat (4)
        move (10) steps
        turn right (90) degrees
    end
</pre>
