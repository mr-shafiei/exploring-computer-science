# Background/Overview:

A **mutation** is simply a mistake that occurs during the creation or copying of a nucleic acid, in particular DNA. Because nucleic acids are vital to cellular functions, mutations tend to cause a ripple effect throughout the cell.

Although mutations are technically mistakes, a very rare mutation may equip the cell with a beneficial attribute. In fact, the macro effects of evolution are attributable by the accumulated result of beneficial microscopic mutations over many generations.


The simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a **point
mutation**, which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide.

By **counting the number of differences** between two homologous DNA strands taken from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of the minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred on the evolutionary path between the two strands.

This measure is called the **'Hamming distance'**

**Example:**

    GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT
    CATCGTAATGACGGCCT
    ^ ^ ^  ^ ^    ^^


These two DNA strands have 7 differences, therefore, the Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.


# Implementation notes

The Hamming distance is **only** defined for sequences of equal length!

For example, the following DNA strands are not the same length, therefore, no Hamming distance can be calculated:

    GAGCCTACTAA
    CATCGTAATGACGGCCT
    

Your program should return an error if the user inputs two DNA strands that are of different lengths!
