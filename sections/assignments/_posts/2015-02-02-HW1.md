# Goals:

1. Develop an abstraction that will draw a regular polygon of a given number of sides.
2. Incorporate that abstraction into a Scratch function
3. Use that function as a part of a more complex program

When you are finished, you should have a Scratch block that looks something like this:

![polygonfunction]({{ site.baseurl }}/media-library/2015/02/polygon-function.png)

And you should be able to use your block like this:

![polygonloop]({{ site.baseurl }}/media-library/2015/02/polygon-loop.png)

So your program draws something like this:

![polygonexample1]({{ site.baseurl }}/media-library/2015/02/polygon-example-1.png)
